    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Hacker News? \n",
    "Hacker News is a social news site founded by the startup incubator Y Combinator. Users submit posts which are voted and commented on. Topics of posts are usually focused on computer science and entreprenuership and the site is popular in technology and startup circles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sources: DataQuest and Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "The data is available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts)\n",
    "However, the dataset provided by DataQuest has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining sumbissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Dictionary**\n",
    "- id: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "- title: The title of the post\n",
    "- url: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n",
    "- num_points: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "- num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "- author: The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "- created_at: The date and time at which the post was submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: Dataquest\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Hacker News Works\n",
    "Posts can be up voted, down voted, and/or commented on. Posts show the Title, number of points, author's user name, how long ago it was posted, and the number of comments. Hacker News has several tabs including:\n",
    " - new\n",
    " - past\n",
    " - comments\n",
    " - ask\n",
    " - show\n",
    "These allow the reader to click and explore Hacker News based on the user's preference. Ask and Show are features of Hacker News where the poster includes Ask HN or Show HN in the title. Ask HN is where a user can ask Hacker News users a question. Show HN is where a user can show Hacker News users a project, product, or interesting thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users then interact by commenting and voting on the post. The Number of points on a post are cacluated by the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "Compare the different types of posts to determine:\n",
    " 1. Do Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more comments on average?\n",
    " 2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    " 3. Do Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more points on average?\n",
    " 4. Do posts created at a certain time receive more points on average?"

Also, the content of the post can also impact the points scores and comments, but we do not have access to that data. That being said, a number of likes or upvotes as well as downvotes can provide a poster feedback about the content being posted, just like the average number of comments, and the hour a post obtains higher interaction can help a poster know when and what type of content could be successful.\n",
