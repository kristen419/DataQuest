A large number of apps for a particular genre does not imply that apps of that genre generally have a large number of users.

    "\n",
    "Reference: It appears that MineCraft guides are currently popular within References. Although this is a niche market, it could be an opportunity for ad revenue. Other game guides are a possibility as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Books: There are not a lot of book apps in the Apple store, this could be a result of Apple's own reading app. However, I think there is an opportunity here for an app that helps recommend books to you. It could also count all the books you have read, not just in Apple and you could create a list of books you want to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "Health and Fitness: Although several are in place, a fitness or weight loss app could be popular and a source of ad revenue. However, it would likely require an expert in health and fitness to guide the product which our company does not have currently. "

To perform computations, however, we'll need to convert each install number from string to float."

    "While Field Guides for games such as MineCraft were popular on the Apple App Store, there does not appear to be the same type of apps in the Google Play Store. The question is - is there a market for this in the Google Play Store that just hasn't been delivered to android users, or, like we noted earlier, games are more popular on Apple devices, while Android is more balanced between pracitcal and fun apps. Because fun apps are still popular, it would be worth further researching the popularity of field guides for popular games. \n",

The BOOK genre has an above average number of users in both data sets and does not contain either too many apps making differentiation difficult or too few apps making it difficult to compete with established, large apps. \n",

    "Reference: While reviewing Reference apps in the Apple Store, apps with Field Guides for popular games like Minecraft were available. These apps however were not in the Google Play Store. I recommend we further research to determine if there is a market for these field guides in the Google Play Store that have simply not been fulfilled yet, or if field guides are less popular with android users. Although this is niche market, it is an opportunity for targeted ads should we continue with this app. "
